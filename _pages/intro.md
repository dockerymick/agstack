The AgStack Foundation seeks to improve global agriculture efficiency through the creation, maintenance and enhancement of free, reusable, open and specialized digital infrastructure for data and applications. Our main goal is to globally enable a suite of software, data tools, and frameworks, and provide access to the agriculture ecosystem for content creators and content consumers. Another goal to highlight is bringing the largest technology companies to agriculture,  leveraging existing open source technology, and promoting community collaboration across companies, developers, and other agriculture users or stakeholders.

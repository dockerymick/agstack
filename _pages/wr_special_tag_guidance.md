Limit special tagging. All special tags use bold text and a bold colon. See the following list on how and when to use special tags:

**Note:** Use for extra information that is helpful.

**Important:** A little stronger than a note.

**Tip:** Use for a shortcut, for instance.

**Best practice:** In place of recommendation. Something you should do for better performance or experience

**Optional:** For any step not required, but user may want to take or needs to take in certain cases. 

  - Example: **Optional:** If you plan to manage more clusters, click such and such for later use.

#### Technology preview

Place **Technology preview** at the highest level of the component that is tech preview on the title (to get this in the navigation). Include a special tag on the What's new entry.

Example:

**Technology preview:** What's new is this is tech preview.

## APIs

Use a plug in to change an API draft from YAML to JSON. You can use, for instance, the VS Code plugin: YAML to JSON.

From the command pallet, you can either copy the clipboard or the selected text and change YAML to JSON.

You will need to copy all the definitions manually.

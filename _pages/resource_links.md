### The basics of writing at Red Hat

- [Writing concisely](https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/conciseness-handout/)

### Style resources

The IBM style guide is the main authority on style issues, but there are supplementary Red Hat style guides you want to take a look at as well.

**Note:** Enter your Red Hat email account. When the Red Hat SSO appears, enter your credentials. Your IBMiD is automatically created after you read the *Important Notice* and proceed to log in.
